# Supporting scripts

Training entry points are `python -m src.experiments.sparse` and
`python -m src.experiments.run`. The legacy local experiment drivers and
study-specific figure recipes have been removed.

## Reusable utilities

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `setup_graphsaint.sh` | Extract and check manually downloaded GraphSAINT datasets. |
| `calibrate_grid.py` | Emit noise multipliers for a grid of privacy targets. |
| `ceiling_fullbatch.py` | Run a non-private full-batch classification comparison. |
| `summarize_sweep.py` | Select a validation-best step and report seed-averaged test results; one configuration per child directory. |
| `summarize_matched_eps.py` | Summarize matched-budget studies using their expected directory naming conventions. |
| `summarize_results.py` | Combine arbitrary result CSVs into CSV/Markdown tables using stored bootstrap CIs or seed mean ± sample SD; optional best-test selection and named regimes. |
| `plot_frontier.py` | Plot privacy–utility curves from an explicit CSV glob. |
| `plot_sparse_frontier.py` | Plot a compatible SparseGNN CSV containing epsilon values. |

The Python utilities expose `--help`. GraphSAINT setup accepts an input ZIP
directory and an optional destination; see the root README.

### Result tables

`summarize_results.py` is standalone and uses only the Python standard library.
Pass CSV files and/or quoted globs; datasets, methods, metrics, and privacy
budgets come from the rows, not directory names. For example:

```bash
python scripts/summarize_results.py 'results/campaign/**/*.csv' \
  --bootstrap --best --out reports/bootstrap

python scripts/summarize_results.py results/run1.csv results/run2.csv \
  --seed --out reports/seeds
```

Each invocation writes both `PREFIX.csv` and `PREFIX.md`. Choose one mode:

- `--bootstrap`: original final-run score with its stored bootstrap CI. Markdown
  uses `$score \pm radius$`, where
  `radius = max(abs(score - lower), abs(upper - score))`: a conservative symmetric
  envelope, not a change to the point estimate. Exact original CI endpoints and
  confidence levels remain in the CSV. Missing CIs show `N/A`; they are not
  recomputed or averaged across seeds.
- `--seed`: mean and sample SD (`ddof=1`) across unique seeds **within each
  configuration**. One seed gives `N/A` SD. Conflicting results for the same
  seed/configuration are errors; use separate groups for distinct runs.

`--best` deliberately selects on **test**, not validation: bootstrap mode picks
the highest-scoring final run and its CI; seed mode picks the configuration with
the highest mean test score and retains its mean/SD. This introduces test-selection
bias, which the output labels. It never chooses an intermediate checkpoint by
test score. Without `--best`, all final runs/configurations remain in the table.
`--metric auto` respects declared primary metrics; `--metric accuracy`, `auroc`,
`micro_f1`, `r2`, or `macro_f1` selects a particular available test metric.
Scores stay on their input scale.

For named regimes, create a JSON configuration such as:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "name": "small learning rate",
      "files": ["results/campaign/**/*.csv"],
      "where": {"lr": [0.001], "p1": 0.01}
    },
    {
      "name": "large learning rate",
      "files": ["results/campaign/**/*.csv"],
      "where": {"lr": [0.01], "p1": 0.01}
    }
  ]
}
```

Run `python scripts/summarize_results.py --groups groups.json --bootstrap --best
--out reports/regimes`. Group paths are relative to the JSON file. Optional
`where` filters use raw CSV column names and scalar or list values; numeric
strings compare numerically. Overlapping file globs are deduplicated per group.
Positional inputs, if supplied as well, form a separate `default` group.

Dataset/split, method, metric, privacy budget, and named groups stay separate.
Hyperparameter aliases are normalized; calibrated noise does not split seed
cohorts at a fixed target epsilon. Non-private rows are labeled `non-private`,
never inferred from `epsilon_context`; private rows without epsilon are labeled
`unknown`. For unknown private epsilon, `--best` keeps different configurations
separate rather than comparing unrecorded privacy budgets. The CSV includes
configuration IDs/settings, selected seeds, source paths, and selection labels.

## Cluster helpers

- `_ice_env.sh`: sourced by the ICE Slurm launchers to configure their environment.
- `_matched_eps_grid.sh`: sourced by `sbatch/graphsaint_meps.sbatch` to run its
  matched-budget grid.

These are source-only helpers, not standalone training commands.

## Study-specific campaign helpers

`sparsegnn_final_sweep.py`, `sparsegnn_final_reports.py`,
`sparsegnn_final_verification.py`, and `sparsegnn_partial_nonprivate.py` are
retained for the initial-tuning study. They depend on that study's Python
modules and original layout; they are not general-purpose experiment commands.
Moving the study under `results/old_stuff/` does not automatically migrate
their imports or paths.
